 Listen to me you got it. You have to eat the dream. You have to sleep the dream. You have to dream the dream. You gotta touch, you have to see it when nobody else sees it. You have to feel it when it's not tangible. You have to believe it when you cannot see it. You've got to be possessed with it. The dream. What's your why? Why do you wake up in the morning? Why do you put on that jersey? Why do you go out and practice? Why? You just said you're giving 50%. You owe you an explanation. You owe you an explanation. You need to look at yourself in the mirror and say why are you only giving 50%? What's wrong with you? So what if you are a true lion? It does not make a difference what the circumstance is. You need to tell you that you owe you something. What changed? I changed. And I stopped being a victim. I stopped saying I've got to wait for good things to happen to me. And I said I'm going to cry. Because every day is a new day. Every moment is a new moment. You've got to go out and show them that I'm a different creature now. Because I'm pissed off for greatness. Because if you ain't pissed off for greatness, that mean you're okay with being mediocre. We get more opportunity than life. More chance than life. To do whatever you're going to do. Whatever legacy you're going to leave. Leave your legacy. I can. I will. I must. That's what lions do. Lions don't cry. Lions don't give up. Lions don't quit. Lions heart it.
