 Listen to me, you got it. You have to eat the dream. You have to sleep the dream. You have to dream the dream. You got to touch, you have to see it when nobody else sees it. You have to feel it when it's not tangible. You have to believe it when you cannot see it. You've got to be possessed with the dream. The dream. Problem with some of y'all, the reason why you don't give 120% every doggone time you get on the field, because you ain't got a why for what you do. You ain't got a why. You got to hear what I'm telling you. If y'all going to be great on that field, you got to have a why. You got to have a reason for why you do what you do. What's your why? Why do you wake up in the morning? Why do you put on that jersey? Why do you go out and practice boxing? You just said you're giving 50%. You owe you an explanation. You owe you an explanation. You need to look at yourself in the mirror and say, why are you only giving 50%? What's wrong with you? So what? If you are a true lion, it does not make a difference what the circumstance is. You need to tell you that you owe yourself. What changed? I changed. And I stopped being a victim. I stopped saying I've got to wait for good things to happen to me. And I said, I'm going to cry. You got to go out and show them that I'm a different creature now. Because I'm pissed off for greatness. Because if you ain't pissed off for greatness, that means you're OK with being mediocre. We get one opportunity in life. One chance in life. To do whatever you're going to do. Whatever legacy you're going to leave. Leave your legacy. I can. I will. I must. That's what lions do. Lions don't cry. Lions don't give up. Lions don't quit. Lions hunt.
