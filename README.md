# PassiveScribe


## Idea
Create Passive Income through the use of prepackaged AI, bots, or other programs.  Specifically these should be put into a pipeline that creates some sort of end product that can be "sold" for money.  Minimal amount of actual human work should need to be utilized during the actual work flow.

## Flow
Download Video -> Pull Audio from Video -> Pipe Video through AI/program that will automatically transcribe video -> Upload Video for Profit

## Technology Needed
* Something to pull audio from video
* Something to transcribe video
* DevOps pipeline to automate everything
* Hardware for everything
